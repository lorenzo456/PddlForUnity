# PddlForUnity

PddlForUnity is a project where I use pddl files, both the domain and the problem file 
and send them to an online pddl planner which solves the problem and returns the goal. 
The returned goal file is then parsed and split, I use this information to move a robot
in Unity, making it behave according to the goal. 


This is a small side project I came up with while folling the course 
Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents at Heriot-Watt University. We used 
pddl to solve problem, but I took it a step further and visualized it using Unity.
